- `/m-security-scan` - Security vulnerability scanning
- `/m-test-generation` - Automated test creation
- `/m-review-code` - Code quality review
- `/m-task-planner` - Task analysis and planning
- `/m-tdd-planner` - Test-driven development planning
- `/m-next-task` - Next action recommendations
- `/m-next-context` - Context compilation and analysis
- `/m-project-cleanup` - Project maintenance

2. **`../.claude/README.md`**:
   - Updated all command references to use `/m-*` prefix
   - Reorganized commands by category
   - Added clear examples with consistent naming

3. **`../.claude/docs/COMMANDS.md`**:
   - Complete command reference with descriptions
   - Usage examples and workflows
   - Category-based organization

4. **Setup scripts**:

- Consistent development environment

### Command Aliases
For convenience, these aliases are available:
```bash
help                 # â†’ /m-help
security-scan        # â†’ /m-security-scan
orchestrated-dev     # â†’ /m-orchestrated-dev
commit-push          # â†’ /m-commit-push
bug-fix             # â†’ /m-bug-fix
# ... and more
```
