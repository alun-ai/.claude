## Data and Analytics Considerations

*A space for documenting the feature’s Data and Analytics implications and requirements. This section should be filled out after discussing the initiative, particularly the proposed [data model](https://www.notion.so/Tech-Spec-Template-0bfa4f0c4f324401818ba23b764a8a2d?pvs=21), with the Data team.*

## Observability Considerations

*A space to document any metrics, logs, and metadata that would help maintain, debug, and operate the initiative in production.*

# Proposed Solutions

## Option 1: <TITLE>

## Components

*A description of the solution’s components and how they work together to implement the solution.*

### Component A

**Description:**

*Component A will be used to provide X functionality by integrating with Component B*

**Dependencies:**

*Work on Component A will be dependent on Component B being in place first.*

**Level of Effort:**

*An attempt to capture a very course-grained idea of the level of effort of the implementation of the component to aid in roadmap discussions and limiting scope.*

### Component B

**Description:**

*Component A will be used to provide X functionality by integrating with Component B*

**Dependencies:**

*Work on Component B will be the foundation upon which we will build Component A. Therefore, it must be completed prior to work on Component A.*

**Level of Effort:**

*An attempt to capture a very course-grained idea of the level of effort of the implementation of the component to aid in roadmap discussions and limiting scope.*
