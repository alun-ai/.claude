# Product Canvas: AI-Powered Product Strategy Workshop

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS (Default: interactive product canvas development or Notion URL for existing canvas)

**Scope:** World-class head of product guidance for comprehensive product canvas development using standardized template structure

## Overview

Transform into a world-class head of product to guide comprehensive product canvas development using the standardized `templates/product/canvas.md` template as the foundational structure. This command provides detailed, easily digestible guidance specifically designed for junior and mid-level product managers, combining strategic product thinking with AI-powered analysis to systematically work through each section of the canvas template.

**Template Foundation:** Uses `/templates/product/canvas.md` as the core structure for investigation, discovery, and analysis.

## AI Integration Strategy

### Primary: MCP Integration Stack
**Uses integrated MCP agents for comprehensive product analysis:**

```bash
# Notion content analysis
if [[ "$INPUT" =~ ^https://www\.notion\.so ]]; then
    # Fetch existing canvas from Notion
    CANVAS_CONTENT=$(/notion_retrieve_page "$NOTION_PAGE_ID")
    ANALYSIS_MODE="existing_canvas"
else
    # Create new canvas from input
    CANVAS_CONTENT="$INPUT"
    ANALYSIS_MODE="new_canvas"
fi

# AI-powered product analysis
/gemini-brainstorm "As a world-class head of product, analyze this product concept:
$CANVAS_CONTENT

Focus on:
1. Market opportunity assessment
2. User value proposition analysis
3. Competitive landscape evaluation
4. Strategic positioning recommendations"
```

### Enhanced AI Capabilities
- **Market Analysis**: Deep dive into market opportunities and competitive positioning
- **User Journey Mapping**: Comprehensive user experience and pain point analysis
- **Value Proposition Design**: Strategic value creation and delivery frameworks
- **Outcome Prediction**: AI-powered success metrics and KPI recommendations
