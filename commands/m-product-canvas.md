# Product Canvas: AI-Powered Product Strategy Workshop

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS (Default: interactive product canvas development or Notion URL for existing canvas)

**Scope:** World-class head of product guidance for comprehensive product canvas development and strategy

## Overview

Transform into a world-class head of product to guide comprehensive product canvas development. This command combines strategic product thinking with AI-powered analysis to help define use cases, desired outcomes, and user value propositions. Supports both creating new canvases and analyzing existing ones from various sources including Notion, pasted content, or interactive development.

## AI Integration Strategy

### Primary: MCP Integration Stack
**Uses integrated MCP agents for comprehensive product analysis:**

```bash
# Notion content analysis
if [[ "$INPUT" =~ ^https://www\.notion\.so ]]; then
    # Fetch existing canvas from Notion
    CANVAS_CONTENT=$(/notion_retrieve_page "$NOTION_PAGE_ID")
    ANALYSIS_MODE="existing_canvas"
else
    # Create new canvas from input
    CANVAS_CONTENT="$INPUT"
    ANALYSIS_MODE="new_canvas"
fi

# AI-powered product analysis
/gemini-brainstorm "As a world-class head of product, analyze this product concept:
$CANVAS_CONTENT

Focus on:
1. Market opportunity assessment
2. User value proposition analysis
3. Competitive landscape evaluation
4. Strategic positioning recommendations"
```

### Enhanced AI Capabilities
- **Market Analysis**: Deep dive into market opportunities and competitive positioning
- **User Journey Mapping**: Comprehensive user experience and pain point analysis
- **Value Proposition Design**: Strategic value creation and delivery frameworks
- **Outcome Prediction**: AI-powered success metrics and KPI recommendations

## Product Canvas Framework

### Core Canvas Components
```yaml

        # Fetch canvas content
        CANVAS_DATA=$(/notion_retrieve_page "$PAGE_ID")
        
        echo "üìã Analyzing existing product canvas from Notion..."
        OPERATION_MODE="analyze_existing"
    else
        # Process text input as new canvas concept
        CANVAS_DATA="$INPUT"
