# Jira Development Start: Initialize Development Workflow

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS (Default: highest priority assigned issue or interactive selection)

**Scope:** Comprehensive development workflow initialization with branch creation, environment setup, and issue tracking

## Overview

Streamlines the start of development work by integrating Jira issue management with git workflows, development environment setup, and automated progress tracking. Ensures proper development patterns and issue linking from the beginning.

## Core Features

### Intelligent Issue Selection
- **Priority-Based Selection**: Automatically suggest highest priority assigned issues
- **Sprint Context**: Focus on current sprint issues with capacity consideration
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identify prerequisite issues and blockers
- **Skill Matching**: Suggest issues matching developer expertise

### Development Environment Setup
- **Branch Creation**: Create properly named feature branches with issue linking
- **Environment Configuration**: Set up development environment for specific issue type
- **Tool Integration**: Configure IDE, debugging, and testing tools
- **Documentation Access**: Quick access to relevant technical documentation

### Progress Tracking Integration
- **Automatic Status Updates**: Transition issue status to "In Progress"
- **Time Tracking Initialization**: Start automatic time logging
- **Milestone Planning**: Set up development checkpoints and goals
- **Team Notifications**: Alert relevant team members of development start

## Execution Steps

1. **Issue Analysis and Selection**
   - Analyze assigned issues and sprint context
   - Evaluate issue dependencies and prerequisites
   - Assess technical complexity and time estimates
   - Present prioritized recommendations with reasoning

2. **Development Planning**
   - Review issue requirements and acceptance criteria
   - Identify technical approach and implementation strategy
   - Plan development milestones and checkpoints
   - Set up tracking and progress monitoring

3. **Environment Initialization**
   - Create feature branch with proper naming convention
   - Set up local development environment
   - Install necessary dependencies and tools
   - Configure debugging and testing environment

4. **Workflow Activation**
   - Update issue status and assign to current user
   - Initialize time tracking and progress monitoring
   - Set up automated progress reporting
   - Configure integration hooks and notifications

## Issue Selection Strategies

### Priority-Based Selection
```yaml
selection_criteria:
  primary_factors:
    - issue_priority: "High > Medium > Low"
    - sprint_assignment: "Current sprint preferred"
    - blocking_issues: "Prioritize blockers"
    - due_dates: "Consider deadlines"
  
  secondary_factors:
    - component_expertise: "Match developer skills"
    - estimated_effort: "Consider available time"
    - dependency_status: "Ensure prerequisites complete"
    - team_coordination: "Avoid conflicts"
```

### Smart Recommendations
```yaml
recommendation_engine:
  developer_profile:
    skills: ["React", "TypeScript", "Node.js"]
    recent_components: ["Frontend", "Authentication"]
    velocity: "8 story points per sprint"
    preferences: ["new features", "architecture"]
  
  issue_matching:
    skill_alignment: 0.9
    complexity_fit: 0.8
    interest_level: 0.7
    team_priority: 1.0
```

## Branch and Environment Setup

### Branch Naming Conventions
```bash
# Feature branches
feature/ALUN-{issue_key}-{short-description}
feature/ALUN-123-oauth-integration

# Bug fix branches  
bugfix/ALUN-{issue_key}-{short-description}
bugfix/ALUN-124-login-error-fix

# Hotfix branches
hotfix/ALUN-{issue_key}-{short-description}
hotfix/ALUN-125-security-patch
