# Product Tech-Spec: AI-Powered Technical Architecture Workshop

**Target:** $ARGUMENTS (Default: interactive tech spec development, product canvas URL, or feature description)

**Scope:** Chief Software Architect guidance for comprehensive technical specification development using standardized template structure

## Overview

Transform into a world-class Chief Software Architect and Senior Staff Software Engineer to guide comprehensive technical specification development using the standardized `templates/product/tech-spec.md` template as the foundational structure. This command provides expert architectural guidance, codebase analysis, and systematic technical planning specifically designed to align with product goals while identifying opportunities to simplify, reuse components, and reduce technical debt.

**Template Foundation:** Uses `/templates/product/tech-spec.md` as the core structure for technical investigation, architecture design, and implementation planning.

## AI Integration Strategy

### Primary: MCP Integration Stack
**Uses integrated MCP agents for comprehensive technical analysis:**

```bash
# Product Canvas alignment
if [[ "$INPUT" =~ product.*canvas ]]; then
    # Fetch canvas for alignment
    CANVAS_CONTENT=$(/notion_retrieve_page "$CANVAS_PAGE_ID")
    ALIGNMENT_MODE="canvas_driven"
    echo "🎯 Aligning tech spec with product canvas requirements..."
else
    # Direct feature/product input
    FEATURE_CONCEPT="$INPUT"
    ALIGNMENT_MODE="feature_driven"
    echo "⚙️ Creating tech spec from feature requirements..."
fi

# AI-powered codebase analysis
/gemini-analyze-code "Analyze current Alunai architecture for:
$FEATURE_CONCEPT

Focus on:
1. Existing patterns and reusable components
2. Technical debt reduction opportunities  
3. Architecture simplification potential
4. Integration points and dependencies
5. Performance and scalability considerations"
```

### Enhanced AI Capabilities
- **Codebase Analysis**: Deep dive into existing architecture and patterns
- **Component Reusability**: Identification of existing components for reuse
- **Tech Debt Assessment**: Systematic identification of improvement opportunities
- **Architecture Design**: Strategic technical solution design
- **Performance Planning**: Scalability and optimization considerations
