# Collaborative Architecture Debate: Dual-AI Strategic Analysis

**Analysis target:** $ARGUMENTS (Default: entire codebase)

**Scope:** Comprehensive architecture analysis using collaborative Gemini-Claude debate process with documented findings

## Overview

Conducts strategic architecture analysis through a collaborative debate between Gemini CLI and Claude Code. This dual-AI approach provides comprehensive evaluation of system design, identifies architectural patterns, and generates strategic recommendations through comparative analysis.

## Dual-AI Collaboration Strategy

### Phase 1: Gemini CLI Initial Analysis
**Primary Analysis Engine**: Gemini CLI performs comprehensive architectural assessment

```bash
# Gemini CLI comprehensive architecture analysis
if command -v gemini >/dev/null 2>&1 && [[ -n "$GEMINI_API_KEY" ]]; then
    echo "=== GEMINI ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS ===" > /tmp/gemini_arch_analysis.md
    
    # System-wide pattern analysis
    gemini --all-files -p "Conduct comprehensive architectural analysis of this codebase.
    
    Analyze:
    1. System-wide architectural patterns and paradigms
    2. Module organization and dependency structure  
    3. Design patterns usage and consistency
    4. Scalability and extensibility considerations
    5. Technical debt and architectural anti-patterns
    6. Security architecture and data flow
    7. Performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
    8. Maintainability and evolution potential
    
    Provide detailed findings with specific code examples and recommendations.
    Format as structured markdown with clear sections." --format markdown >> /tmp/gemini_arch_analysis.md
    
    # Component interaction analysis
    echo -e "\n## Component Interaction Analysis" >> /tmp/gemini_arch_analysis.md
    gemini --all-files -p "Analyze component interactions and dependencies.
    Create a detailed assessment of:
    - Inter-module communication patterns
    - Data flow architecture
    - API design consistency
    - Service layer organization
    - Database integration patterns
    
    Include recommendations for improvement." --format markdown >> /tmp/gemini_arch_analysis.md
fi
```

### Phase 2: Claude Code Review and Counter-Analysis
**Review and Debate Engine**: Claude analyzes Gemini's findings and provides alternative perspectives

```bash
# Claude reviews Gemini's analysis and provides counter-perspective
if [[ -f /tmp/gemini_arch_analysis.md ]]; then
    echo "Claude Code will now review Gemini's architectural analysis..."
    echo "Generating comprehensive debate document..."
fi
```

### Phase 3: Collaborative Synthesis
**Final Output**: Generate comprehensive debate document in `/docs/architecture-debate-YYYYMMDD.md`

## Execution Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Verify both Gemini CLI and Claude Code availability
   - Create timestamped output file in `/docs/`
   - Initialize collaborative analysis framework

2. **Gemini Initial Analysis** 
   - Comprehensive architectural assessment
   - Pattern recognition and design evaluation
   - Technical debt identification
   - Performance and scalability analysis

3. **Claude Review and Debate**
   - Review Gemini's findings critically
   - Provide alternative perspectives and solutions
   - Identify areas of agreement and disagreement
   - Synthesize comparative recommendations

4. **Documentation Generation**
   - Create comprehensive debate document
   - Include both AI perspectives with analysis
   - Provide final synthesized recommendations
   - Generate actionable improvement roadmap
