- **2 points**: Simple (~1-2 days) - Small features, straightforward bug fixes  
- **3 points**: Moderate (~2-3 days) - Standard features, moderate complexity
- **5 points**: Complex (~3-5 days) - Significant features, architectural changes
- **8 points**: Large (~5-8 days) - Major features, multiple system integration
- **13 points**: Epic (~8-13 days) - Complex features requiring design/research
- **21 points**: Too Large - Should be split into smaller stories
