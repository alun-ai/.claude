    validation: ["test_fails_as_expected", "error_messages_clear"]
    
  green_phase:
    purpose: "Write minimal code to make test pass"

    parallel_execution: "4x faster with parallelization"
    
  code_quality_standards:
    test_maintainability: "Clear, readable, and self-documenting tests"
    test_isolation: "No dependencies between test cases"
    test_reliability: "99%+ test pass rate in CI/CD"
```

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage with meaningful tests
2. **Fast Execution**: Optimize for quick feedback cycles
3. **Reliable Results**: Ensure tests are deterministic and stable
4. **Easy Maintenance**: Write tests that are easy to understand and modify

### Team Collaboration
1. **Shared Understanding**: Ensure team alignment on TDD practices
2. **Code Review**: Include test quality in code review processes
