    # Discover development workflows
    discover_development_patterns
    
    # Identify team conventions
    extract_coding_conventions
    
    # Generate onboarding plan
    create_personalized_onboarding_plan
}

detect_technology_stack() {
    echo "üîé TECHNOLOGY STACK DETECTION"
    echo "-----------------------------"
    
    # Use comprehensive analysis to detect stack
