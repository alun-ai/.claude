## ðŸ’¡ Command Usage Tips

### Chaining Commands
Many commands work well in sequence:
```bash
# Full development cycle
/m-task-planner â†’ /m-orchestrated-dev â†’ /m-test-generation â†’ /m-commit-push

# Quality assurance cycle
/m-review-code â†’ /m-security-scan â†’ /m-project-cleanup â†’ /m-document-update

# Architecture review cycle
/m-debate-architecture â†’ /m-debate-code â†’ /m-task-planner â†’ /m-tdd-planner
```

### Context Awareness
Commands automatically adapt to:
- **Project type** (Next.js, Python, Rust, etc.)
- **Current git state** (branch, uncommitted changes)
- **Available tools** (package managers, frameworks)
- **Previous command history** (learning from usage patterns)

### Parallel Execution
Some commands can run simultaneously:
- Security scanning while development continues
- Documentation updates alongside code reviews
- Branch cleanup during inactive development periods

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Usage

### Custom Parameters
Most commands accept optional parameters:
```bash
/m-security-scan dependencies       # Focus on dependency vulnerabilities
/m-review-code src/auth deep        # Deep review of auth module
/m-test-generation unit 90%         # Generate unit tests with 90% coverage
/m-bug-fix #123                     # Fix specific GitHub issue
```

### Environment Integration
Commands integrate with shared Nix environment:
```bash
# Environment tools available during command execution
dashboard                          # View development metrics
security                          # Quick security check
cache-status                      # Check dependency cache
monitor                           # System monitoring
```

### Project-Specific Behavior
Commands adapt based on project configuration:
- **Next.js projects**: Include Vercel deployment, Supabase integration
- **Python projects**: Use Poetry, pytest, Black formatting
- **Rust projects**: Cargo workflows, clippy linting
- **Go projects**: Module management, golangci-lint

## ðŸŽ› Configuration

### Shared Configuration
All commands inherit from `../.claude/settings.base.json`:
- Common permissions and security settings
- Shared environment variables
- Standard command aliases

### Project Overrides
Each project can customize in `.claude/settings.local.json`:
```json
{
  "extends": "../.claude/settings.base.json",
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      // Project-specific permissions
    ]
  },
  "workflows": {
    "custom-workflow": ["command1", "command2"]
  }
}
```

### Command Aliases
Shortcuts available for all commands:
```bash
# Short forms (without /m- prefix)
help                              # â†’ /m-help
security-scan                     # â†’ /m-security-scan
orchestrated-dev                  # â†’ /m-orchestrated-dev
# ... etc
```

## ðŸ†˜ Getting Help

### General Help
```bash
/m-help                           # Context-aware help
/m-help commands                  # List all commands
/m-help troubleshooting          # Common issues
```

### Command-Specific Help
```bash
/m-help security                  # Security-related help
/m-help workflows                 # Development workflows
/m-help setup                     # Setup and configuration
```

### Context-Specific Help
```bash
/m-help project                   # Project-specific guidance
/m-help newbie                    # Beginner-friendly explanations
/m-help error                     # Error resolution help
```

## ðŸ“Š Command Metrics

The system tracks command usage and provides insights:
- **Frequency**: Most-used commands per project
- **Success rates**: Command completion statistics
- **Performance**: Execution times and optimization opportunities
- **Patterns**: Common command sequences and workflows

Access metrics through:
```bash
dashboard                         # Overall development metrics
claude-cmd metrics               # Detailed command statistics
/m-help usage                    # Usage pattern analysis
```
